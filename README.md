# Awesome DragonRuby

![](./dragonruby-logo.png)

[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](http://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) DragonRuby Game Toolkit is a professional grade 2D game engine. It's tiny (~3.5MB), fast, and cross-platform (including consoles and mobile). The managing members of DragonRuby are Ryan C. Gordon (core contributor of SDL), Amir Rajan (critically acclaimed indie game dev), Aaron Lasseigne (author, presenter, and a powerhouse Ruby developer), and Alex Denisov (LLVM specialist).
